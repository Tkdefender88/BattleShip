# BattleShip

![Go](https://github.com/Tkdefender88/BattleShip/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

This was the semester project for my web science class. This project was used 
to teach the class about the basics of web development. This project allows a user to
create and save different battle ship configurations. Then the player can enter a
battle with another client that implements the battleship API. Once in battle the two
servers will take turns firing shots and the client is able to view the battle as it
progresses. Each student was intended to create an instance of the application
following the battleship API and implement a firing strategy that their server would
follow during the battle phase.
